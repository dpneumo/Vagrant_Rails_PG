Symlink creation on Win7
  Requires Pro
  User should not be an administrator to avoid UAC query for each attempt to create a symlink
  As an administrator run secpol.msc
    Local Policy => User Rights Assignment
    Give the user CreateSymbolicLink priv and save
  User must login after the priv has ben set to pick up the priv.
  At cmd prompt running whoami /priv will show privleges the user has.
    Create Symbolic Links will show as "Disabled" BUT mklink command will now work
